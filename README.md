## Description

Sweepers is a web based full-stack application designed to help households manage chores and who needs to do them.  Many houses manage chores on paper, but having a web application allows anyone in the household to access the chore chart no matter where they are.  We thought that we could solve this problem, and create a chore chart that we would be happy to use in our own homes. We learned to effectively link and utilise databases through sequel, as well as handlebars and sessions.


## Planning
We started with a wireframe of our two pages, our homepage and chore page.  Originally we had separate pages for log in and sign up, but decided a modal for creating accounts was more streamlined for the user.
Log in page:

Signup page:

Admin view of the chore page:

Standard user view of the chore page:

We also planned the way our databases would interact and created a diagram showing the flow of data.

## Technical Requirements

All technical requirements were accomplished for this project. The technical requirements are as follows: 

- Use a library outside of what we were taught in class (Materialize)
- Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
-Include user authentication
- Host servers
- Use databses to store persistent data
- Be responsive to different screen sizes
- Have a polished UI
- Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.)
- Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application)
- Be deployed to Heroku

## Features

## Future Development

There are multiple opportunities for future development with this site:
- Adding a log out function
- Creating a way to store and gain points
- Read-only for standard users
- Linking to popular calendar programs
- Graphics on user columns to show progress towards goals
- More complete admin control
